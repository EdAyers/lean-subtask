# Human-oriented Term Rewriting.

A prototype implementation of the subtasks algorithm in Lean for solving simple equalities.


## Build & Run

This code runs using Lean 3.4.2.

1. Install [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover/lean). [TODO] provide more guidance on this.
2. It is recommended that you view the examples files within the supported editors: vscode or emacs. 
3. Open this directory and run `leanpkg build`. This will pull and verify mathlib and will take about 20 mins.
4. Open any file from the examples folder and inspect Lean Messages to see the `equate` tactic in action
